I missed [`torrench`](https://github.com/deechoe/torrench) after it stopped working in my system. I usually would use it to check what is up in the latest releases from PirateBay, so I decided as a holidays project to achieve this very simple behaviour of listing latest releases.

There you go. Enjoy.


P.S.: I am open to PRs, specially on handling errors and properly activating the proxies (see code).
