# Intro

I missed [torrench](https://github.com/deechoe/torrench) after it stopped working in my system. I usually would use it to check what is up in the latest releases from PirateBay, so I decided, as a holidays project, to achieve this very simple behaviour of listing latest releases.

There you go. Enjoy.
